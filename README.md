Food insecurity description of variable
Food insecurity is a variable presented by County Health & Rankings Roadmaps, the variable is meant to measure the lack of consistent food access and the ability of individuals and families to secure balanced meals. The variable describes the percentage of the population (complete set of individual units of interest) who did not have access to a reliable food source (Food Insecurity*, n.d.). The U.S. The Department of Agriculture debriefs that there are a variety of factors that go into measuring food insecurity but that the following are always considered. 
Accessibility to sources of healthy food, as measured by distance to a store or by the number of stores in an area;
Individual-level resources that may affect accessibility, such as family income or vehicle availability; and
Neighborhood-level indicators of resources, such as the average income of the neighborhood and the availability of public transportation (USDA ERS - Documentation, n.d.).
County Health & Rankings Roadmaps collected the data for the food insecurity variable from the Map the Meal Gap model which relied on the Core Food Insecurity Model which uses information from the Community Population Survey, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and American Community Survey to collect the data (Food Insecurity*, n.d.).
